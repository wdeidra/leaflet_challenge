 Leaflet Challenge: Interactive Mapping with GeoJSON Data

## Overview
This challenge allowed me to create an **interactive map** using **Leaflet**, a popular JavaScript library for web mapping. The map visualized **geographical and statistical data** in an engaging and interactive way, leveraging the power of **GeoJSON files**.

## Project Objectives
1. **Visualize GeoJSON Data**:
   - Parse GeoJSON data to display geographical features on a map.
   - Use markers, polygons, or other visual elements to represent data.

2. **Add Interactive Features**:
   - Include popup information for map elements to enhance user interaction.
   - Incorporate features like zoom levels, layers, or toggling map views.

3. **Style Enhancements**:
   - Customize the mapâ€™s appearance with styling options such as colors, markers, or overlays.
   - Use CSS or JavaScript to add dynamic effects.

4. **Showcase Insights**:
   - Display meaningful insights about the dataset through visual mapping.
   - Highlight areas of interest or patterns using data representation techniques.

## Key Deliverables
- A functional Leaflet map integrated into a webpage.
- Clean and aesthetic styling for the map and its components.
